For this project we are allowing groups to earn up to 10 points of extra credit by creating their own unit tests or by improving the thoroughness of the provided tests.

In order to receive extra credit, groups *must* include a plain text file called "EXTRACREDIT" in the "libkademlia" directory. Students must also include a clear explanation of what each new or improved function is testing. The list of functions to be considered for E.C. must go in the "EXTRACREDIT" file. Explanations can either go in the "EXTRACREDIT" file or in the comments of the group's *_test.go* file. You can either add to the provided test file, or create a new one (just be clear in your explanation).

Each new "test" of functionality can earn between 0 and 5 points, depending on the complexity and usefulness of the test. Note that a individual function can "test" multiple aspects of Kademlia, as the provided test functions do. However, each aspect of functionality that is being tested must be explained.

Tests that are, for the most part, redundant with the existing tests will not receive credit. Groups can earn a maximum of 10 points total.
